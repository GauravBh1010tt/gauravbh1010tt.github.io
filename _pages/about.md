Hi, my name is Gaurav Bhatt. I am a PhD student in CV-ML Lab at the University of British Columbia. My supervisor is Dr. Leonid Sigal. Previously, I have worked as a Research Assistant under Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian at IIT-Hyderabad. My research interest spans across deep learning, representation learning, zero/few-shot learning, domain translations, and continual learning.

In my free time I like playing badminton, table tennis, or listening to music. I was a addicted DOTA2 player at some point of time :)
