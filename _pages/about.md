Hello, my name is Gaurav Bhatt. I am a PhD student in the CV-ML Lab at the University of British Columbia, where I work with Dr. <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/people.html"> Leonid Sigal</a>. Previously, I served as a Research Assistant under Dr. <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/alumni.html"> Vineeth N. Balasubramanian</a> at IIT-Hyderabad. My research experience include deep learning, representation learning, zero/few-shot learning, domain translations, and continual learning. Quiet recently, I have started working on safe and realiable use of LLMs and GenAI models.

I am also an affiliated researcher at the <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/research/researchers/"> Vector Institute for AI</a> in Toronto. At the Vector Institute, I worked as a Technical Facilitator for the FastLane program, RAG boot camps and BIAS in AI workshop, supervising machine learning teams from various companies such as RBC Data Science, Canadian Tire, Scotia Bank, FirstHX, RealSage, NextIntelligence, and Formic-AI.

In the summer of 2024, I began my internship at Amazon Science in Palo Alto, where my project focuses on counterfactual reward maximization for data driven ranking. I am collaborating with Kiran Thekumparampil, Tanmay Gangwani, Evan Sheehan, and Holakou Rahmanian.

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and table tennis, or listening to music. I used to be an avid DOTA2 player. :)
